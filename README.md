This project showcases a fully functional 8-bit binary calculator built in CircuitVerse, designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations at the logic gate level. The project demonstrates an understanding of digital logic, combinational and sequential circuit design, and modular subcircuit construction.

Features & Modules
  8-Bit Ripple-Carry Adder: Constructed using chained full-adders; verified via truth tables and binary test cases.

  Twoâ€™s Complement & Subtractor: Converts subtrahends using NOT gates and binary addition of 1 to enable binary subtraction.

  Binary Multiplier: Implements the shift-and-add multiplication algorithm with multiplexers, splitters, and a custom accumulator structure.

  Binary Divider: Uses repeated subtraction logic, custom multiplexers, and signal cascading to compute 4-bit quotient and remainder from 8-bit inputs.

  Integrated Calculator: All modules are combined into a cohesive calculator system supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
